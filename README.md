## Work Experience

**Machine Learning Researcher @ University of Cauca (_October 2025 - Present_)**
- Implemented an end-to-end Azure pipeline for B2B hardware sales analytics (NVIDIA), delivering executive dashboards with insights on revenue, commercial performance, and win/loss rates. Analyzed over 100K sales transactions across 14 locations in Europe, Asia and America.
- Applied Natural Language Processing techniques, including BERTopic, to identify key themes in residential construction logbooks and obtained an executive dashboard.

**Researcher in ML/AI @ Instituto Tecnológico de Aguascalientes (_April 2025 - September 2025_)**
- Developed Machine Learning pipelines to predict activity durations in residential construction projects, improving scheduling accuracy by 84% (MAE reduced from 7.5 days to 1.2 days).
- Built project cost prediction models using XGBoost, SHAP, Random Forest, and neural networks to assess market-driven risk.

**Data Scientist @ Creatic Technological Development Center (_May 2021 - Februrary 2025_)**
- Developed predictive models to detect delays in construction projects, supporting strategic decision-making at the executive level.
- Implemented fuzzy logic models to estimate optimistic and pessimistic delivery dates for contractors on the RYKWA platform [https://creaticrykwa.com].
- Conducted statistical analyses to support marketing department innovation strategies and technology protection initiatives.

**Researcher in Systems Modeling and Machine Learning @ University of Strathclyde (_November 2022 - December 2022_)**
- Analyzed vertical ground reaction force signals from gait recordings of 64 patients with ALS, HD, and PD, achieving 91% accuracy in differential diagnosis and early detection of neurodegenerative diseases to support clinical decision-making and model dissemination.

## Science Communication Project
I create educational science content on TikTok, explaining scientific papers and patents in Spanish. One of my most viewed videos (+40K views) on nuclear power plant location in Colombia sparked public discussion on safety, policy, and community guarantees, demonstrating my ability to communicate complex topics with real societal impact.

## Data Science Projects
### Azure Based Data Analysis for Sales and Revenues for a B2B Hardware company
End-to-end cloud analytics solution built on Microsoft Azure to transform raw B2B sales data into executive insights. The project automates data ingestion, processing, and visualization using Azure Blob Storage, Data Factory, Databricks, and Power BI. It answers key business questions on revenue trends, client profitability, product performance, sales effectiveness, and win/loss dynamics, enabling management to identify growth opportunities, focus on high-impact clients and sectors, and improve commercial strategy through data-driven decisions.

### Fuzzy‑logic delivery date estimation framework for the Task Manager and Meetings Scheduler RYKWA
This project introduces an uncertainty visualization framework for project scheduling using fuzzy logic. Task completion uncertainty is modeled with triangular membership functions and transformed into an intuitive dashboard-style vector representation, enabling real-time decision-making. The approach supports both industry applications and educational use by helping users understand and manage uncertainty dynamically.
