## Work Experience

**Machine Learning Researcher @ University of Cauca (_October 2025 - Present_)**
- Implemented an end-to-end Azure pipeline for B2B hardware sales analytics (NVIDIA), delivering executive dashboards with insights on revenue, commercial performance, and win/loss rates. Analyzed over 100K sales transactions across 14 locations in Europe, Asia and America.
- Applied Natural Language Processing techniques, including BERTopic, to identify key themes in residential construction logbooks and obtained an executive dashboard.

**Researcher in ML/AI @ Instituto Tecnológico de Aguascalientes (_April 2025 - September 2025_)**
- Developed Machine Learning pipelines to predict activity durations in residential construction projects, improving scheduling accuracy by 84% (MAE reduced from 7.5 days to 1.2 days).
- Built project cost prediction models using XGBoost, SHAP, Random Forest, and neural networks to assess market-driven risk.

**Data Scientist @ Creatic Technological Development Center (_May 2021 - Februrary 2025_)**
- Developed predictive models to detect delays in construction projects, supporting strategic decision-making at the executive level.
- Implemented fuzzy logic models to estimate optimistic and pessimistic delivery dates for contractors on the RYKWA platform [https://creaticrykwa.com].
- Conducted statistical analyses to support marketing department innovation strategies and technology protection initiatives.

**Researcher in Systems Modeling and Machine Learning @ University of Strathclyde (_November 2022 - December 2022_)**
- Analyzed vertical ground reaction force signals from gait recordings of 64 patients with ALS, HD, and PD, achieving 91% accuracy in differential diagnosis and early detection of neurodegenerative diseases to support clinical decision-making and model dissemination.

## Science Communication Project
I create educational science content on TikTok, explaining scientific papers and patents in Spanish. One of my most viewed videos (+40K views) on nuclear power plant location in Colombia sparked public discussion on safety, policy, and community guarantees, demonstrating my ability to communicate complex topics with real societal impact.
